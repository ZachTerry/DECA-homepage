          <div class="cropped"> <img src="images/decaexec.jpeg" style="height: 205px;"> </div>
          <p>The deadline is approaching to start the process</p>
          <p>The greatest thing about leadership within DECA is that there is infinite room for growth and there is
            equality of opportunity for all members. The classical progression of student leadership goes from chapter
            office to association office to executive office.

            If you’re questioning whether you should apply, here are some things to consider: When approaching a
            leadership position, it’s important to understand why you’re considering it in the first place. For many,
            leadership is a way to gain popularity and name recognition, build a resume and travel. But the best leaders
            are also driven by a desire to give back and serve others. DECA is a student-led organization committed to
            preparing emerging leaders around the world so a servant leadership mindset is more beneficial than an
            ego-centric approach. Please reach out the the exec board for more information. DECA is a local, state, and
            international organization with a mission to prepare emerging leaders and entrepreneurs for careers in
            marketing, finance, hospitality, and management. Career focused students build skills through DECA
            competition, conferences and business mentoring.
